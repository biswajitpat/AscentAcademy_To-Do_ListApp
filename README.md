A basic To-Do List App will have a dynamic and responsive UI that allows you to create several to-do 
lists for daily tasks and easily add or remove items from the list. For this project, you must have a 
basic understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap. Furthermore, the 
arrangement of Bootstrap’s grid system will be advantageous. 
In this project, you will need to write JavaScript methods mainly for the following tasks: adding user 
input to lists, deleting entries from lists, displaying items on the screen, etc.

This project is a part of Internship Under @AscentAcademy.
